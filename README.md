# [Entirety.ai](https://entiretydotai.github.io/blogs/about/) -  Learn Haskell Virtual Study Group


![](images/haskell-logo.png)


All the books, resources and study plan for learning Haskell.

# Guidelines


## To prepare for your first visit, please do the following:

- **Join the [Learn-Haskell](https://join.slack.com/t/learnhaskell/shared_invite/zt-iu8rnyyq-~a8cCdcMhKZ7yqzl4gLpVQ/) Slack community.**
All announcements pertaining to this study group will be sent out on Slack. On the `Learn Haskell` Slack, look for the `#haskell-study-group` channel.
- Get yourself a pen, paper and computer with active Internet Connection. In the First session we will go through the entire setup process for installing Haskell Compiler GHC and VScode. But it would nice if this could be done before hand by following the [Installation guideline](https://github.com/kowainik/learn4haskell#installing-haskell)
- No prior experience with Haskell, functional programming, or coding in general is required. An open mind is also recommended.


## Expectations

Participants in the study group will be expected to model and reinforce a culture of accountability. This entails everyone abiding by the norms of a supportive and rigorous classroom environment. Each week, you should complete the following tasks:

- Do all the reading.
- Type in all the code.
- Attempt all the exercises.
- Meet with a study partner to discuss your work.
- Attend the group meeting.

These expectations are not meant to make your life miserable but to provide a framework for your success. If you actually want to learn Haskell, consistency is the key—as with anything else. Since we'll be learning Haskell together in this group, it is essential that you work through each chapter on your own first so that you come to each group meeting prepared, knowing what you need help with and what you understand well enough to teach others. If you get stuck on a problem, keep moving, but do not just skip the exercises entirely.

#### For the sake of emphasis: _do not skip the exercises!_

If you are a complete beginner to programming or for whatever reason have trouble installing Haskell on your computer, don't worry about it! Come to the study group, and we'll help you figure it out. Fortunately, you don't even need a computer to work through Chapter 1—just pen, paper, and patience. So make sure you at least do that much, even if you require tech support.

## Conduct of code

By participating in this study group, you implicitly agree to conduct your coding as follows:

Each week, prior to the group meeting, you will complete the assigned reading and attempt to complete the coding exercises to the best of your ability. If you do not make a genuine effort to complete your work, for whatever reason, you will not be permitted to join the group discussion that week. Participants who fail to complete their assignments twice in a row or three times total, or who are otherwise not making a good faith effort to keep up with the course schedule, may be asked to leave the group. If you find yourself struggling with the exercises, you should seek help at the meetings, from your study partner, or online.

You will make every effort to attend the weekly group meetings. Space is limited, so if you cannot commit to attending regularly, do not sign up. Participants who consistently miss meetings or RSVP without showing up will be removed from the group. If you cannot make it to a meeting, withdraw your RSVP as soon as possible.

In addition to the above, all study group participants are expected to make their best effort at being decent human beings. Participants whose behaviour strays too far or too often beyond the reasonable boundaries of respect, kindness, and collegiality may be removed from the group at the discretion of the organizer.

The [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com) has a useful set of [social rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) that you should consider in effect for our meetings, too.

## Format.

**This is not a class**, however, so do not come expecting a lecture. Instead, you will have the opportunity to review your work and to discuss concepts and exercises that gave you difficulty when working through the book on your own.

You are encouraged to hew as closely to this regular, weekly schedule as you are able so as to maintain your momentum. That said, if life gets in the way, so be it: but do your best to catch up, and avoid skipping any material as each chapter builds on the last. We can always discuss exercises on Slack, but please refrain from posting your solutions publicly (including on GitHub).

## Signing up

All meetings will be announced and Slack. You must RSVP to attend each meeting separately, as space is at a premium. If you cannot attend a meeting because it is full, please continue to work on your own, and come to a future meeting. Do not RSVP if you cannot attend. No-shows will not be allowed to attend subsequent meetings.

Meeting days and  times may vary from week to week depending on the everyone's availability.


# Study Plan

## Goals

Primary Goal of the Study group.

1. Learn Haskell in Detail.

If the study group is a success next Goal to achieve.

1. Learn Data Structure in Haskell Way
2. Implement Data Structure and Algorithms in Haskell and in your primary programming Language.

## Plan

We will work through [*Haskell Programming from First Principles*](http://haskellbook.com/) (aka the "Haskell Book") by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki.

For 1st  4 weeks from the starting date of the study group we will move in a slow pace, testing everything out in phases subsequently deciding a rigid study plan.
