# Study Plan

## Goals

Primary Goal of the Study group.

1. Learn Haskell in Detail.

If the study group is a success next Goal to achieve.

1. Learn Data Structure in Haskell Way
2. Implement Data Structure and Algorithms in Haskell and in your primary programming Language.

## Format

We will work through [*Haskell Programming from First Principles*](http://haskellbook.com/) (aka the "Haskell Book") by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki.

For 1st  4 weeks from the starting date of the study group we will move in a slow pace, testing everything out in phases subsequently deciding a rigid study plan.
